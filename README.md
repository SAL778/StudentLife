Project Name: StudentLife
Team Memebers: Gurtej Singh, Ivoine Strachan, Jeslyn Chang, and Saahil Rachh 


Project Description: Student Life

Our project is a web-based platform that allows students to upload and share videos showcasing their homework assignments, projects, and academic accomplishments. It will enable students (k-12th grade) to demonstrate their skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities while fostering a supportive community of learners.

Modifications: we didn't modify any service because a similar one doesn't exist

Pre-existing structures in schools are trying to fix the lack of student-teacher communication,
which includes student anxiety about approaching teachers for help.
