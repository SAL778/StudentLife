## Project Description:

StudentLife is a web-based platform designed to empower students (K-12) to showcase their academic accomplishments by uploading and sharing videos of their homework assignments, projects, and more. The platform fosters a supportive community of learners, allowing students to demonstrate their skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.

## Technology Stack

- Our computers

**Modifications/Integrations**

- Integrations: google authentication
- Modifications: we didn't modify any service because a similar one
doesn't exist  *(Pre-existing structures in schools are trying to fix the lack of
student-teacher communication, which includes student anxiety
about approaching teachers for help)*

- Next.js *(front-end)*
- Prisma *(To connect the back end and store user accounts/videos)*

over to Figma)*
