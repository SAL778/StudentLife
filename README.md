## **StudentLife**


**Team Members:** 

*Gurtej Singh, Ivoine Strachan, Jeslyn Chang, Saahil Rachh*

## Project Description:

A website called StudentLife targeted towards students in grades Kâ€“12 to upload videos of their projects, homework, and other assignments. Classmates can upload videos on our website to provide answers and explanations to help students that are hesitant to approach teachers. These peers can access the website for guidance and pick up on methods that others are using in the same classroom online while still promoting collaborative learning.
